Summary: The <code>log4j</code> quickstart demonstrates how to use container defined modules to add dependencies on 3rd party libraries and limit the application package size.<br />
Target Product: JBoss EAP<br />

<h2><a href="#what-is-it" id="what-is-it">What is it?</a></h2>
<p>The <code>log4j</code> quickstart is a simple JSF application that shows how to use container defined modules to limit the size of the application package in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. It also shows how to use common versions of certain classes at runtime.</p>
<p>Applications must often depend on third-party libraries. By default, Java EE packages allow you to include dependencies in a deployable unit which can lead to uncontrolled growth of the deployable unit. This can be avoided by the use of container defined modules. A module is nothing more than a container managed binary dependency which is shared by all deployed applications.</p>
<p>This example is very simple. It declares dependency on the Apache Log4j module which allows it to use a custom logging framework. This is achieved with a simple addition to the xml file: <code>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jboss-deployment-structure.xml</code>. This file and modular class loading are described in more detail in the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/">Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform</a> documentation.</p>
<h2><a href="#system-requirements" id="system-requirements">System Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 or later.</p>
<p>All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.3.1 or later. See <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts">Configure Maven for JBoss EAP 7.1</a> to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.</p>
<h2><a href="#use-of-eap7-home" id="use-of-eap7-home">Use of EAP7_HOME</a></h2>
<p>In the following instructions, replace <code>EAP7_HOME</code> with the actual path to your JBoss EAP installation. The installation path is described in detail here: <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP7_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables">Use of EAP7_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#start-the-server" id="start-the-server">Start the Server</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.</li>
<li>The following shows the command line to start the server:
<pre><code>For Linux:   EAP7_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
For Windows: EAP7_HOME\bin\standalone.bat
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#build-and-deploy-the-quickstart" id="build-and-deploy-the-quickstart">Build and Deploy the Quickstart</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li>Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
<pre><code>mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will deploy <code>target/log4j.war</code> to the running instance of the server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#access-the-application" id="access-the-application">Access the Application</a></h2>
<p>The application will be running at the following URL: <a href="http://localhost:8080/log4j/">http://localhost:8080/log4j/</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#undeploy-the-archive" id="undeploy-the-archive">Undeploy the Archive</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li>When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:
<pre><code>mvn wildfly:undeploy
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p>You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a JBoss EAP server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts">Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#debug-the-application" id="debug-the-application">Debug the Application</a></h2>
<p>If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.</p>
<pre><code>    mvn dependency:sources
</code></pre>
