# helloworld-mutual-ssl-secured: Securing a Web Application with Mutual (two-way) SSL Configuration and Role-based Access Control

Author: Giriraj Sharma, Stefan Guilhen  
Level: Intermediate  
Technologies: Mutual SSL, Security, Undertow  
Summary: The `helloworld-mutual-ssl-secured` quickstart demonstrates securing a Web application using client mutual SSL authentication and role-based access control  
Target Product: JBoss EAP  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/>  

## What is it?

This example demonstrates the configuration of *mutual SSL authentication* in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 to secure a war application.

Mutual SSL provides the same security as SSL, with the addition of authentication and non-repudiation of the client authentication, using digital signatures. When mutual authentication is used, the server would request the client to provide a certificate in addition to the server certificate issued to the client. Mutual authentication requires an extra round trip time for client certificate exchange. In addition, the client must buy and maintain a digital certificate. We can secure our war application deployed over JBoss EAP with mutual(two-way) client certificate authentication and provide access permissions or privileges to legitimate users.

This quickstart shows how to configure JBoss EAP to enable TLS/SSL configuration for the new JBoss EAP `undertow` subsystem and enable mutual (two-way) SSL authentication for clients in order to secure a WAR application with restricted access.

## System Requirements

The applications these projects produce are designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 or later.

All you need to build these projects is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.3.1 or later. See [Configure Maven for JBoss EAP 7.1](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

To run these quickstarts with the provided build scripts, you need the JBoss EAP distribution ZIP. For information on how to install and run JBoss EAP, see the [Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/) _Getting Started Guide_ located on the Customer Portal.

You can also use [JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse](#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) to run the quickstarts.

## Use of EAP7_HOME

In the following instructions, replace `EAP7_HOME` with the actual path to your JBoss EAP installation. The installation path is described in detail here: [Use of EAP7_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP7_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables).

## Add the Application Users

Using the add-user utility script, you must add the following user to the `ApplicationRealm`:

| **UserName** | **Realm** | **Password** | **Roles** |
|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|:-----------|
| quickstartUser| ApplicationRealm | quickstartPwd1!| JBossAdmin |

For the purpose of this quickstart the password can contain any valid value because the `ApplicationRealm` will be used for authorization only, for example, to obtain the security roles.

To add the application user, open a command prompt and type the following commands:

        For Linux:
          EAP7_HOME/bin/add-user.sh -a -u 'quickstartUser' -p 'quickstartPwd1!' -g 'JBossAdmin'

        For Windows:
          EAP7_HOME\bin\add-user.bat  -a -u 'quickstartUser' -p 'quickstartPwd1!' -g 'JBossAdmin'

If you prefer, you can use the add-user utility interactively.
For an example of how to use the add-user utility, see the instructions located here: [Add an Application User](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CREATE_USERS.md#add-an-application-user).

## Setup Client and Server Keystores Using Java Keytool

1.  Open a command line and navigate to the JBoss EAP server `configuration` directory:

        For Linux:   EAP7_HOME/standalone/configuration
        For Windows: EAP7_HOME\standalone\configuration
2. Create a certificate for your server using the following command:

        $>keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keystore server.keystore -storepass secret -keypass secret -validity 365

        What is your first and last name?
           [Unknown]:  localhost
        What is the name of your organizational unit?
           [Unknown]:  wildfly
        What is the name of your organization?
           [Unknown]:  jboss
        What is the name of your City or Locality?
           [Unknown]:  Raleigh
        What is the name of your State or Province?
           [Unknown]:  Carolina
        What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
           [Unknown]:  US
        Is CN=localhost, OU=wildfly, O=jboss, L=Raleigh, ST=Carolina, C=US correct?
           [no]:  yes

3. Create the client certificate, which is used to authenticate against the server when accessing a resource through SSL.

        $>keytool -genkey -keystore client.keystore -storepass secret -validity 365 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype pkcs12

        What is your first and last name?
            [Unknown]:  quickstartUser
        What is the name of your organizational unit?
            [Unknown]:  Sales
        What is the name of your organization?
            [Unknown]:  My Company
        What is the name of your City or Locality?
            [Unknown]:  Sao Paulo
        What is the name of your State or Province?
            [Unknown]:  Sao Paulo
        What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
            [Unknown]:  BR
        Is CN=quickstartUser, OU=Sales, O=My Company, L=Sao Paulo, ST=Sao Paulo, C=BR correct?
            [no]:  yes

    Notice that we set the `fisrt and last name` to `quickstartUser` and that this matches the user we've added to the
    `ApplicationRealm`. When authorizing access to a resource, the CN (common name) of the client's certificate is
    extracted by a principal decoder and this name is then used by the `ApplicationRealm` to obtain the client's roles.

4. Export the client certificate and create a truststore by importing this certificate:

        $>keytool -exportcert -keystore client.keystore  -storetype pkcs12 -storepass secret -keypass secret -file client.crt
        $>keytool -import -file client.crt -alias quickstartUser -keystore client.truststore -storepass secret

        Owner: CN=quickstartUser, OU=Sales, O=My Company, L=Sao Paulo, ST=Sao Paulo, C=BR
        Issuer: CN=quickstartUser, OU=Sales, O=My Company, L=Sao Paulo, ST=Sao Paulo, C=BR
        Serial number: 7fd95ce4
        Valid from: Mon Jul 24 16:14:03 BRT 2017 until: Tue Jul 24 16:14:03 BRT 2018
        Certificate fingerprints:

        ]
        ]

        Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes
        Certificate was added to keystore

    It is worth noticing that the client certificate was imported under the `quickstartUser` alias. When authenticating a
    client in a `CLIENT_CERT` configuration, the CN (common name) of the client's certificate is extracted by a principal
    decoder and this name is then used by the `KeyStoreRealm` to match an alias in the trust store. If a trusted certificate
    is found under this alas, the client is considered authenticated.

5. Export client certificate to pkcs12 format

        $>keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore client.keystore -srcstorepass secret -destkeystore clientCert.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -deststoretype PKCS12 -deststorepass secret

6. The certificates and keystores are now properly configured.

## Configure the Server

These steps assume you are running the server in standalone mode and using the default `standalone.xml` supplied with the distribution.

You configure the SSL context and required security domain by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-ssl.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

1. Before you begin, back up your server configuration file
    * If it is running, stop the JBoss EAP server.
    * Back up the file: `EAP7_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`
    * After you have completed testing this quickstart, you can replace this file to restore the server to its original configuration.

2. Start the JBoss EAP server by typing the following:

        For Linux:  EAP7_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows:  EAP7_HOME\bin\standalone.bat
3. Review the `configure-ssl.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. Comments in the script describe the purpose of each block of commands.

4. Open a new command prompt, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing EAP7_HOME with the path to your server:

        For Linux: EAP7_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-ssl.cli
        For Windows: EAP7_HOME\bin\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=configure-ssl.cli
    You should see the following result when you run the script:

        The batch executed successfully
        process-state: reload-required

5. Stop the JBoss EAP server.

## Review the Modified Server Configuration

After stopping the server, open the `EAP7_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file and review the changes.

1. The following `key-store`s were added to the `elytron` subsystem:

        <key-store name="qsKeyStore">
            <credential-reference clear-text="secret"/>
            <implementation type="JKS"/>
            <file path="server.keystore" relative-to="jboss.server.config.dir"/>
        </key-store>
        <key-store name="qsTrustStore">
            <credential-reference clear-text="secret"/>
            <implementation type="JKS"/>
            <file path="client.truststore" relative-to="jboss.server.config.dir"/>
        </key-store>

2. The following `key-manager` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:

        <key-managers>
            <key-manager name="qsKeyManager" key-store="qsKeyStore">
                <credential-reference clear-text="secret"/>
            </key-manager>
        </key-managers>

3. The following `trust-manager` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:

        <trust-managers>
            <trust-manager name="qsTrustManager" key-store="qsTrustStore"/>
        </trust-managers>

4. The following `ssl-context` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:

        <server-ssl-contexts>
            <server-ssl-context name="qsSSLContext" protocols="TLSv1.2" need-client-auth="true" key-manager="qsKeyManager" trust-manager="qsTrustManager"/>
        </server-ssl-contexts>

5. The following realms were added to the `elytron` subsystem:

        <key-store-realm name="KeyStoreRealm" key-store="qsTrustStore"/>

        <aggregate-realm name="QuickstartRealm" authentication-realm="KeyStoreRealm" authorization-realm="ApplicationRealm"/>

    The `aggregate-realm` defines different security realms for authentication and authorization. In this case, the
    `KeyStoreRealm` is responsible for authenticating the principal extracted from the client's certificate and the `ApplicationRealm` is responsible for obtaining the roles required to access the application.

6. The following `principal-decoder` and `security-domain` were added to the `elytron` subsystem:

        <x500-attribute-principal-decoder name="QuickstartDecoder" attribute-name="cn"/>

        <security-domain name="QuickstartDomain" default-realm="QuickstartRealm" permission-mapper="default-permission-mapper" principal-decoder="QuickstartDecoder">
            <realm name="QuickstartRealm" role-decoder="groups-to-roles"/>
        </security-domain>

    The `x500-attribute-principal-decoder` creates a new `Principal` from the CN attribute of the `X500Principal` obtained
    from the client's certificate. This new principal is supplied to the security realms and is also the principal returned
    in methods like `getUserPrincipal` and `getCallerPrincipal`.

7. The following `http-authentication-factory` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:

        <http-authentication-factory name="quickstart-http-authentication" http-server-mechanism-factory="global" security-domain="QuickstartDomain">
            <mechanism-configuration>
                <mechanism mechanism-name="CLIENT_CERT"/>
            </mechanism-configuration>
        </http-authentication-factory>

    It defines the security domain that will handle requests using the `CLIENT_CERT` HTTP mechanism.

8. The `https-listener` in the `undertow` subsystem was changed to reference the `qsSSLContext` `ssl-context`:

        <https-listener name="https" socket-binding="https" ssl-context="qsSSLContext" enable-http2="true"/>

9. The following `application-security-domain` was added to the `undertow` subsystem:

        <application-security-domains>
            <application-security-domain name="client_cert_domain" http-authentication-factory="quickstart-http-authentication"/>
        </application-security-domains>

    It maps the `client_cert_domain` from the quickstart application to the `http-authentication-factory` shown above, so requests made to the application go through the configured HTTP authentication factory.

## Test the Server SSL Configuration

To test the SSL configuration, access: <https://localhost:8443>

If it is configured correctly, you should be asked to trust the server certificate.

## Import the Certificate into Your Browser

Before you access the application, you must import the *clientCert.p12*, which holds the client certificate, into your browser.

#### Import the Certificate into Google Chrome

1. Click the Chrome menu icon (3 dots) in the upper right on the browser toolbar and choose 'Settings'. This takes you to <chrome://settings/>.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the 'Advanced' link to reveal the advanced settings.
3. Search for the 'Manage Certificates' line under 'Privacy and security' and then click on it.
4. In the 'Manage certificates' screen, select the 'Your Certificates' tab and click on the 'Import' button.
5. Select the `clientCert.p12` file. You will be prompted to enter the  password: `secret`.
6. The client certificate is now installed in the Google Chrome browser.

#### Import the Certificate into Mozilla Firefox

1. Click the 'Edit' menu item on the browser menu and choose 'Preferences'.
2. A new window will open. Select the 'Advanced' icon and after that the 'Certificates' tab.
3. On the 'Certificates' tab, mark the option 'Ask me every time' and click the 'View Certificates' button.
4. A new window will open. Select the 'Your Certificates' tab and click the 'Import' button.
5. Select the `clientCert.p12` file. You will be prompted to enter the  password: `secret`.
6. The certificate is now installed in the Mozilla Firefox browser.

## Start the Server

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server with the web profile:

        For Linux:   bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: bin\standalone.bat

## Build and Deploy the Quickstart

_NOTE: The following build command assumes you have configured your Maven user settings. If you have not, you must include Maven setting arguments on the command line. See [Build and Deploy the Quickstarts](../README.md#build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) for complete instructions and additional options._

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of one of the quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean package wildfly:deploy

4. This will deploy `target/helloworld-mutual-ssl-secured.war` to the running instance of the server.
5. In case mutual ssl is configured properly and war app is secured, you will be able to access the application only if the DN of client certificate i.e., `clientCert.p12` is same as the one mentioned in `app-roles.properties` file. It will otherwise result into a `HTTP Status 403` or forbidden error.

## Access the Application

The application will be running at the following URL: `<https://localhost:8443/helloworld-mutual-ssl-secured>`. A page displaying the caller
principal and the client certificate used for mutual SSL should be visible:

        Hello World ! Mutual SSL client authentication is successful and your war app is secured.!!

        Caller Principal: quickstartUser

        Client Certificate Pem: MIIDhTCCAm2gAwIBAgIEf9lc5DANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADBzMQswCQYDVQQGEwJCUjESMBAGA1UECBMJU2FvIFBhdW

## Run the Quickstart in JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a JBoss EAP server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts).

* Be sure to configure the server by running the JBoss CLI commands as described above under [Configure the JBoss EAP Server](#configure-the-server). Stop the server at the end of that step.
* Be sure to [Restore the Server Configuration](#restore-the-server-configuration) when you have completed testing this quickstart.

## Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

        mvn dependency:sources
