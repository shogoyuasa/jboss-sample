# managed-executor-service: Managed Executor Service example

Author: Rafael Benevides  
Level: Beginner  
Technologies: EE Concurrency Utilities, JAX-RS, JAX-RS Client API  
Summary: The `managed-executor-service` quickstart demonstrates how Java EE applications can submit tasks for asynchronous execution.  
Target Product: JBoss EAP  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/>  


## What is it?

The Managed Executor Service (javax.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedExecutorService) allows Java EE applications to submit tasks for asynchronous execution. It is an extension of Java SE's Executor Service (java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService) adapted to the Java EE platform requirements.

Managed Executor Service instances are managed by the application server, thus Java EE applications are forbidden to invoke any lifecycle related method.

A JAX-RS resource provides access to some operations that are executed asynchronously.

This quickstart does not contain any user interface. The tests must be run to verify everything is working correctly.

_Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!_

_Note: This quickstart uses a `*-ds.xml` datasource configuration file for convenience and ease of database configuration. These files are deprecated in JBoss EAP and should not be used in a production environment. Instead, you should configure the datasource using the Management CLI or Management Console. Datasource configuration is documented in the [Configuration Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/) for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform._

## System Requirements

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 or later.

All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.3.1 or later. See [Configure Maven for JBoss EAP 7.1](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.


## Start the Server

1. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the  JBoss EAP directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server with the default profile:

        For Linux:   EAP7_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: EAP7_HOME\bin\standalone.bat


## Run the Arquillian Tests

This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container.

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:

        mvn clean verify -Parq-remote

You can also let Arquillian manage the JBoss EAP server by using the `arq-managed` profile. For more information about how to run the Arquillian tests, see [Run the Arquillian Tests](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/RUN_ARQUILLIAN_TESTS.md#run-the-arquillian-tests).

## Investigate the Server Console Output

Look at the JBoss EAP console or Server log and you should see log messages like the following:

Note that the PersistTask and DeleteTask were executed after ProductResourceRESTService sends a Response. The only exception is for LongRunningTask where ProductResourceRESTService waits for its response.


## Server Log: Expected Warnings and Errors

_Note:_ You will see the following warnings in the server log. You can ignore these warnings.

    WFLYJCA0091: -ds.xml file deployments are deprecated. Support may be removed in a future version.

    HHH000431: Unable to determine H2 database version, certain features may not work


## Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a JBoss EAP server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts).

To run the tests in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio, you must first set the active Maven profile in project properties to one of the following:

* `arq-remote`: This setting is used for a remote server. JBoss Developer Studio starts the server for you.
* `arq-managed`:  This setting is used for a managed server. If you use this setting, you must [start the server](#start-the-server) before you run the tests.

Then, to run the tests, right click on the project or individual classes and select `Run As` --> `JUnit Test` in the context menu.

## Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

    mvn dependency:sources
