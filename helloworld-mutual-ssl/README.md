# helloworld-mutual-ssl: JBoss EAP Mutual SSL(two-way) Configuration Example

Author: Giriraj Sharma, Stefan Guilhen  
Level: Intermediate  
Technologies: Mutual SSL, Undertow  
Summary: The `helloworld-mutual-ssl` quickstart is a basic example that demonstrates mutual SSL configuration in JBoss EAP  
Target Product: JBoss EAP  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/>  

## What is it?

Mutual SSL provides the same security as SSL, with the addition of authentication and non-repudiation of the client authentication, using digital signatures. When mutual authentication is used, the server requests the client to provide a certificate in addition to the server certificate issued to the client. Mutual authentication requires an extra round trip each time for client certificate exchange. In addition, the client must buy and maintain a digital certificate.

This quickstart shows how to configure JBoss EAP to enable TLS/SSL configuration for the new JBoss EAP `undertow` subsystem and enable mutual (two-way) SSL authentication.

Before you run this example, you must create certificates and configure the server to use two-way SSL.

## System Requirements

The applications these projects produce are designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 or later.

All you need to build these projects is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.3.1 or later. See [Configure Maven for JBoss EAP 7.1](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.

To run these quickstarts with the provided build scripts, you need the JBoss EAP distribution ZIP. For information on how to install and run JBoss, see the [Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform Documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/) _Getting Started Guide_ located on the Customer Portal.

You can also use [JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse](#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts) to run the quickstarts.

## Use of EAP7_HOME

In the following instructions, replace `EAP7_HOME` with the actual path to your JBoss EAP installation. The installation path is described in detail here: [Use of EAP7_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP7_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables).

## Set Up Client and Server Keystores Using Java Keytool

1.  Open a command line and navigate to the JBoss EAP server `configuration` directory:

        For Linux:   EAP7_HOME/standalone/configuration
        For Windows: EAP7_HOME\standalone\configuration
2. Create a certificate for your server using the following command:

        $>keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -keystore server.keystore -storepass secret -keypass secret -validity 365

        What is your first and last name?
           [Unknown]:  localhost
        What is the name of your organizational unit?
           [Unknown]:  wildfly
        What is the name of your organization?
           [Unknown]:  jboss
        What is the name of your City or Locality?
           [Unknown]:  Raleigh
        What is the name of your State or Province?
           [Unknown]:  Carolina
        What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
           [Unknown]:  US
        Is CN=localhost, OU=wildfly, O=jboss, L=Raleigh, ST=Carolina, C=US correct?
           [no]:  yes

3. Create the client certificate, which is used to authenticate against the server when accessing a resource through SSL.

        $>keytool -genkey -keystore client.keystore -storepass secret -validity 365 -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype pkcs12

        What is your first and last name?
            [Unknown]:  quickstartUser
        What is the name of your organizational unit?
            [Unknown]:  Sales
        What is the name of your organization?
            [Unknown]:  My Company
        What is the name of your City or Locality?
            [Unknown]:  Sao Paulo
        What is the name of your State or Province?
            [Unknown]:  Sao Paulo
        What is the two-letter country code for this unit?
            [Unknown]:  BR
        Is CN=quickstartUser, OU=Sales, O=My Company, L=Sao Paulo, ST=Sao Paulo, C=BR correct?
            [no]:  yes

4. Export the client certificate and create a truststore by importing this certificate:

        $>keytool -exportcert -keystore client.keystore  -storetype pkcs12 -storepass secret -keypass secret -file client.crt
        $>keytool -import -file client.crt -alias quickstartUser -keystore client.truststore -storepass secret

        Owner: CN=quickstartUser, OU=Sales, O=My Company, L=Sao Paulo, ST=Sao Paulo, C=BR
        Issuer: CN=quickstartUser, OU=Sales, O=My Company, L=Sao Paulo, ST=Sao Paulo, C=BR
        Serial number: 7fd95ce4
        Valid from: Mon Jul 24 16:14:03 BRT 2017 until: Tue Jul 24 16:14:03 BRT 2018
        Certificate fingerprints:
	         MD5:  87:41:C5:CC:E6:79:91:F0:9D:90:AD:9E:DD:57:81:80

        ]
        ]

        Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes
        Certificate was added to keystore

5. Export client certificate to pkcs12 format

        $>keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore client.keystore -srcstorepass secret -destkeystore clientCert.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -deststoretype PKCS12 -deststorepass secret

6. The certificates and keystores are now properly configured.

## Configure the Server

These steps assume you are running the server in standalone mode and using the default `standalone.xml` supplied with the distribution.

You configure the SSL context by running JBoss CLI commands. For your convenience, this quickstart batches the commands into a `configure-ssl.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart.

1. Before you begin, back up your server configuration file
    * If it is running, stop the JBoss EAP server.
    * Back up the file: `EAP7_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml`
    * After you have completed testing this quickstart, you can replace this file to restore the server to its original configuration.

2. Start the JBoss EAP server by typing the following:

        For Linux:  EAP7_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows:  EAP7_HOME\bin\standalone.bat
3. Review the `configure-ssl.cli` file in the root of this quickstart directory. Comments in the script describe the purpose of each block of commands.

4. Open a new command prompt, navigate to the root directory of this quickstart, and run the following command, replacing EAP7_HOME with the path to your server:

        For Linux: EAP7_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect --file=configure-ssl.cli
        For Windows: EAP7_HOME\bin\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=configure-ssl.cli
    You should see the following result when you run the script:

        The batch executed successfully
        process-state: reload-required

5. Stop the JBoss EAP server.

## Review the Modified Server Configuration

After stopping the server, open the `EAP7_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file and review the changes.

1. The following `key-store`s were added to the `elytron` subsystem:

        <key-store name="qsKeyStore">
            <credential-reference clear-text="secret"/>
            <implementation type="JKS"/>
            <file path="server.keystore" relative-to="jboss.server.config.dir"/>
        </key-store>
        <key-store name="qsTrustStore">
            <credential-reference clear-text="secret"/>
            <implementation type="JKS"/>
            <file path="client.truststore" relative-to="jboss.server.config.dir"/>
        </key-store>

2. The following `key-manager` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:

        <key-managers>
            <key-manager name="qsKeyManager" key-store="qsKeyStore">
                <credential-reference clear-text="secret"/>
            </key-manager>
        </key-managers>

3. The following `trust-manager` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:

        <trust-managers>
            <trust-manager name="qsTrustManager" key-store="qsTrustStore"/>
        </trust-managers>

4. The following `ssl-context` was added to the `elytron` subsystem:

        <server-ssl-contexts>
            <server-ssl-context name="qsSSLContext" protocols="TLSv1.2" need-client-auth="true" key-manager="qsKeyManager" trust-manager="qsTrustManager"/>
        </server-ssl-contexts>

5. The `https-listener` in the `undertow` subsystem was changed to reference the `qsSSLContext` `ssl-context`:

        <https-listener name="https" socket-binding="https" ssl-context="qsSSLContext" enable-http2="true"/>

## Test the Server SSL Configuration

To test the SSL configuration, access: <https://localhost:8443>

If it is configured correctly, you should be asked to trust the server certificate.

2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn wildfly:undeploy

## Restore the Server Configuration

You can restore the original server configuration by running the  `restore-configuration.cli` script provided in the root directory of this quickstart or by manually restoring the back-up copy the configuration file.

### Restore the Server Configuration by Running the JBoss CLI Script

1. Start the JBoss EAP server by typing the following:

        For Linux:  EAP7_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows:  EAP7_HOME\bin\standalone.bat

        For Windows: EAP7_HOME\bin\jboss-cli.bat --connect --file=restore-configuration.cli
    This script reverts the changes made to the `undertow` subsystem and it also removes the `ssl-context`, `key-manager`, `trust-manager` and `key-store`s
from the `elytron` subsystem. You should see the following result when you run the script:

        The batch executed successfully
        process-state: reload-required

### Restore the Server Configuration Manually

1. If it is running, stop the JBoss EAP server.
2. Replace the `EAP7_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` file with the back-up copy of the file.
