# batch-processing: Chunk oriented Batch 1.0 processing

Author: Rafael Benevides  
Level: Intermediate  
Technologies: CDI, Batch 1.0, JSF  
Summary: The `batch-processing` quickstart shows how to use chunk oriented batch jobs to import a file to a database.  
Target Product: JBoss EAP  
Source: <https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/>  


## What is it?

This quickstart simulates a file importation using batch jobs. To make it easy, this quickstart offers the user a way to generate files. The generate file can have its name and the number of records customized. The user may also specify if the file contains an error or not.

The Job contains two steps (tasks):

1. Import the file (Chunk oriented) - The chunk size was set to `3`. The `RecordsReader` is responsible for parsing the file and create an instance of `Contact`. The `ContactsFormatter` applies the proper case to the Contact name and it also applies a mask to the phone number. Finally, `ContactsPersister` will send the Contact instance to the Database.
2. Log the number of records imported

The database schema defines that the column for name is unique. For that reason, any atempt to persist a duplicate value will throw an exception. On the second attempt to run the job, the `ChunkCheckpoint` will provide information to skip the Contacts that were already persisted.  

_Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!_

_Note: This quickstart uses a `*-ds.xml` datasource configuration file for convenience and ease of database configuration. These files are deprecated in JBoss EAP and should not be used in a production environment. Instead, you should configure the datasource using the Management CLI or Management Console. Datasource configuration is documented in the [Configuration Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/) for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform._

## System Requirements

The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 or later.

All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.3.1 or later. See [Configure Maven for JBoss EAP 7.1](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts) to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.


## Use of EAP7_HOME

In the following instructions, replace `EAP7_HOME` with the actual path to your JBoss EAP installation. The installation path is described in detail here: [Use of EAP7_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP7_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables).



## Start the Server


1. Open a command line and navigate to the root of the  JBoss EAP directory.
2. The following shows the command line to start the server with the default profile:

        For Linux:   EAP7_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
        For Windows: EAP7_HOME\bin\standalone.bat


## Build and Deploy the Quickstart

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command line and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. Type this command to build and deploy the archive:

        mvn clean package wildfly:deploy
4. This will deploy `target/batch-processing.war` to the running instance of the server.


## Access the Application

Access the running application in a browser at the following URL:  <http://localhost:8080/batch-processing/>

You are presented with a simple form that allows you to generate sample files to be imported.

### Usage 1: Import the file without any errors

Click on `Generate a new file and start import job` button. This will generate a new file with 10 unique records to be imported. After the file is generated, the import job will start.

You will see a table containing information about the task that was just started. You can click on `Update jobs list` button and verify that the job was completed.

#### Investigate the Console Output

At the logs you will see that the files with 10 records were processed using 3 records at a time.

### Usage 2: Import an error file and fix it

Now we will simulate a file with duplicate records. This will raise an exception and stop the processing. After that, we will fix the file and continue the importing where it stopped.

Mark the `Generate a duplicate record` checkbox and click on `Generate a new file and start import job` button. If you click on `Update jobs list` button, you will see that the job failed with the following Exit Status: `Error : org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: could not execute statement`. This was caused because the job tried to insert a duplicate record at the Database. You will also see `org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Unique index or primary key violation` exception stacktraces in the server log.

Now we will fix the file and restart that job execution. Uncheck the `Generate a duplicate record` checkbox and click on `Generate a new file` button. This will generate file without errors.

Click on `Restart` button in the last column for that job instance in the `List of Jobs` table. If you  click on `Update jobs list` button, you will see that the job was completed.

Analyze the logs and check that the job started from the last checkpoint.

### Usage 3: Import an error file and do not fix the errors

Check the `Generate a duplicate record` checkbox and click on `Generate a new file ans start import job` button. If you click on `Update jobs list` button, you will see that the job failed with the following Exit Status: `Error : org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: could not execute statement`. This was caused because we tried to insert a duplicate record at the Database.

This time we will not fix the file. Just click on `Restart` button again. If you  click on `Update jobs list` button, you will see that the job was marked as `ABANDONED` this time because it was restarted once. Notice that there is a new parameter: `restartedOnce=true`. This behavior was implemented at `JobListener` for demonstration purpose to avoid that a `FAILED` job that was already restarted once, to be restarted twice.

## Server Log: Expected Warnings and Errors

_Note:_ You will see the following warnings in the server log. You can ignore these warnings.

    WFLYJCA0091: -ds.xml file deployments are deprecated. Support may be removed in a future version.

    HHH000431: Unable to determine H2 database version, certain features may not work

## Undeploy the Archive

1. Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.
2. Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.
3. When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:

        mvn wildfly:undeploy


## Run the Quickstart in Red Hat JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse

You can also start the server and deploy the quickstarts or run the Arquillian tests from Eclipse using JBoss tools. For general information about how to import a quickstart, add a JBoss EAP server, and build and deploy a quickstart, see [Use JBoss Developer Studio or Eclipse to Run the Quickstarts](https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_JBDS.md#use-jboss-developer-studio-or-eclipse-to-run-the-quickstarts).


## Debug the Application

If you want to debug the source code of any library in the project, run the following command to pull the source into your local repository. The IDE should then detect it.

    mvn dependency:sources


<!-- Build and Deploy the Quickstart to OpenShift - Coming soon! -->
