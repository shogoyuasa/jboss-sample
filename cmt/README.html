<p>Author: Tom Jenkinson<br />
Level: Intermediate<br />
Technologies: EJB, CMT, JMS<br />
Summary: The <code>cmt</code> quickstart demonstrates Container-Managed Transactions (CMT), showing how to use transactions managed by the container.<br />
Target Product: JBoss EAP<br />
Source: <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/">https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/</a></p>
<h2><a href="#what-is-it" id="what-is-it">What is it?</a></h2>
<p>The <code>cmt</code> quickstart demonstrates using transactions managed by the container in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. It is a fairly typical scenario of updating a database and sending a JMS message in the same transaction. A simple MDB is provided that prints out the message sent but this is not a transactional MDB and is purely provided for debugging purposes.</p>
<p>Aspects touched upon in the code:</p>
<ol>
<li>XA transaction control using the container managed transaction annotations</li>
<li>XA access to the standard default datasource using the JPA API</li>
<li>XA access to a JMS queue</li>
</ol>
<p>After users complete this quickstart, they are invited to run through the following quickstarts:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../jts/README.html">jts</a> - The JTS quickstart builds upon this quickstart by distributing the CustomerManager and InvoiceManager</li>
<li><a href="../jts-distributed-crash-rec/README.html">jts-distributed-crash-rec</a> - The crash recovery quickstart builds upon the <a href="../jts/README.html">jts</a> quickstart by demonstrating the fault tolerance of JBoss EAP.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!</em></p>
<h3><a href="#what-are-container-managed-transactions" id="what-are-container-managed-transactions">What are Container Managed Transactions?</a></h3>
<p>Prior to EJB, getting the right incantation to ensure sound transactional operation of the business logic was a highly specialised skill. Although this still holds true to a great extent, EJB has provided a series of improvements to allow simplified transaction demarcation notation that is therefore easier to read and test.</p>
<p>With CMT, the EJB container sets the boundaries of a transaction. This differs from BMT (bean managed transactions) where the developer is responsible for initiating and completing a transaction via the methods begin, commit, rollback on a <code>javax.transaction.UserTransaction</code>.</p>
<h3><a href="#what-makes-this-an-example-of-container-managed-transactions" id="what-makes-this-an-example-of-container-managed-transactions">What Makes This an Example of Container Managed Transactions?</a></h3>
<p>Take a look at <code>org.jboss.as.quickstarts.cmt.ejb.CustomerManagerEJB</code>. You can see that this stateless session bean has been marked up with the @javax.ejb.TransactionAttribute annotation.</p>
<p>The available options for this annotation are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Required - As demonstrated in the quickstart. If a transaction does not already exist, this will initiate a transaction and complete it for you, otherwise the business logic will be integrated into the existing transaction</li>
<li>RequiresNew - If there is already a transaction running, it will be suspended, the work performed within a new transaction which is completed at exit of the method and then the original transaction resumed.</li>
<li>Mandatory - If there is no transaction running, calling a business method with this annotation will result in an error</li>
<li>NotSupported - If there is a transaction running, it will be suspended and no transaction will be initiated for this business method</li>
<li>Supports - This will run the method within a transaction if a transaction exists, alternatively, if there is no transaction running, the method will not be executed within the scope of a transaction</li>
<li>Never - If the client has a transaction running and does not suspend it but calls a method annotated with Never then an EJB exception will be raised.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#system-requirements" id="system-requirements">System Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 or later.</p>
<p>All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.3.1 or later. See <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts">Configure Maven for JBoss EAP 7.1</a> to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.</p>
<h2><a href="#use-of-eap7-home" id="use-of-eap7-home">Use of EAP7_HOME</a></h2>
<p>In the following instructions, replace <code>EAP7_HOME</code> with the actual path to your JBoss EAP installation. The installation path is described in detail here: <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP7_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables">Use of EAP7_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#start-the-server-with-the-full-profile" id="start-the-server-with-the-full-profile">Start the Server with the Full Profile</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.</li>
<li>The following shows the command line to start the server with the full profile:
<pre><code>For Linux:   EAP7_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
For Windows: EAP7_HOME\bin\standalone.bat -c standalone-full.xml
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#build-and-deploy-the-quickstart" id="build-and-deploy-the-quickstart">Build and Deploy the Quickstart</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li>Type this command to build and deploy the archive:
<pre><code>mvn clean install wildfly:deploy
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will deploy <code>target/cmt.war</code> to the running instance of the server.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#access-the-application" id="access-the-application">Access the Application</a></h2>
<p>The application will be running at the following URL: <a href="http://localhost:8080/cmt/">http://localhost:8080/cmt/</a>.</p>
<p>You will be presented with a simple form for adding customers to a database.</p>
<p>After a user is successfully added to the database, a message is produced containing the details of the user. An example MDB will dequeue this message and print the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>Received Message: Created invoice for customer named:  Jack
</code></pre>
<p>When the same customer name is given, a duplicate warning is given and no JMS-message is send to cause the above message.</p>
<p>The customer name should match: letter &amp; '-', otherwise an error is given. This is to show that a 'LogMessage' entity is still stored in the database thanks to the <code>@TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW)</code> that the method logCreateCustomer in the EJB LogMessageManagerEJB is decorated with.</p>
<h2><a href="#server-log-expected-warnings-and-errors" id="server-log-expected-warnings-and-errors">Server Log: Expected Warnings and Errors</a></h2>
<p><em>Note:</em> You will see the following warnings in the server log. You can ignore these warnings.</p>
<pre><code>HHH000431: Unable to determine H2 database version, certain features may not work
</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#undeploy-the-archive" id="undeploy-the-archive">Undeploy the Archive</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li>When you are finished testing, type this command to undeploy the archive:
<pre><code>mvn wildfly:undeploy
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
