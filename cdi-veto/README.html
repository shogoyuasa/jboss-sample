<p>Author: Jason Porter<br />
Level: Intermediate<br />
Technologies: CDI<br />
Summary: The <code>cdi-veto</code> quickstart is a simple CDI Portable Extension that uses SPI classes to show how to remove beans and inject JPA entities into an application.<br />
Target Product: JBoss EAP<br />
Source: <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/">https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/</a></p>
<h2><a href="#what-is-it" id="what-is-it">What is it?</a></h2>
<p>The <code>cdi-veto</code> quickstart demonstrates a simple CDI portable extension and some of the SPI classes used to complete that task in an application deployed to Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform. This particular extension explores the <code>ProcessInjectionTarget</code> and <code>InjectionTarget</code> SPI classes of CDI to demonstrate removing a bean from CDI's knowledge and correctly injecting JPA entities in your application.</p>
<p>A portable extension is an extension to Java EE 6 and above, which is tailored to a specific use case and will run on any Java EE 6 or later implementation. Portable extensions can implement features not yet supported by the specifications, such as type-safe messages or external configuration of beans.</p>
<p>The project contains very simple domain model classes, an extension class, the service provider configuration file, and an Arquillian test to verify the extension is working correctly.</p>
<p>This quickstart does not contain any user interface. The tests must be run to verify everything is working correctly.</p>
<p><em>Note: This quickstart uses the H2 database included with Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1. It is a lightweight, relational example datasource that is used for examples only. It is not robust or scalable, is not supported, and should NOT be used in a production environment!</em></p>
<p><em>Note: This quickstart uses a <code>*-ds.xml</code> datasource configuration file for convenience and ease of database configuration. These files are deprecated in JBoss EAP and should not be used in a production environment. Instead, you should configure the datasource using the Management CLI or Management Console. Datasource configuration is documented in the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-enterprise-application-platform/">Configuration Guide</a> for Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.</em></p>
<h2><a href="#system-requirements" id="system-requirements">System Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 or later.</p>
<p>All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.3.1 or later. See <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts">Configure Maven for JBoss EAP 7.1</a> to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.</p>
<h2><a href="#use-of-eap7-home" id="use-of-eap7-home">Use of EAP7_HOME</a></h2>
<p>In the following instructions, replace <code>EAP7_HOME</code> with the actual path to your JBoss EAP installation. The installation path is described in detail here: <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/USE_OF_EAP7_HOME.md#use-of-eap_home-and-jboss_home-variables">Use of EAP7_HOME and JBOSS_HOME Variables</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#start-the-server" id="start-the-server">Start the Server</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root of the JBoss EAP directory.</li>
<li>The following shows the command line to start the server:
<pre><code>For Linux:   EAP7_HOME/bin/standalone.sh
For Windows: EAP7_HOME\bin\standalone.bat
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#run-the-arquillian-tests" id="run-the-arquillian-tests">Run the Arquillian Tests</a></h2>
<p>This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li>Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:
<pre><code>mvn clean verify -Parq-remote
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also let Arquillian manage the JBoss EAP server by using the <code>arq-managed</code> profile. For more information about how to run the Arquillian tests, see <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/RUN_ARQUILLIAN_TESTS.md#run-the-arquillian-tests">Run the Arquillian Tests</a>.</p>
<h2><a href="#investigate-the-console-output" id="investigate-the-console-output">Investigate the Console Output</a></h2>
<p>Maven prints summary of the 4 performed tests to the console.</p>

<p>In the server log you see a few lines similar to</p>
<pre><code>         INFO  [VetoExtension] (MSC service thread 1-8) Vetoed class class org.jboss.as.quickstart.cdi.veto.model.Car
