<p>Author: Paul Robinson<br />
Level: Intermediate<br />
Technologies: WS-BA, JAX-WS<br />
Summary: The <code>wsba-participant-completion-simple</code> quickstart deploys a WS-BA (WS Business Activity) enabled JAX-WS Web service WAR (ParticipantCompletion Protocol).<br />
Target Product: JBoss EAP<br />

<h2><a href="#what-is-it" id="what-is-it">What is it?</a></h2>
<p>The <code>wsba-participant-completion-simple</code> quickstart demonstrates the deployment of a WS-BA (WS Business Activity) enabled JAX-WS Web service bundled in a WAR archive (ParticipantCompletion Protocol) for deployment to Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.</p>
<p>The Web service exposes a simple 'set' collection as a service. The Service allows items to be added to the set within a Business Activity.</p>
<p>The example demonstrates the basics of implementing a WS-BA enabled Web service. It is beyond the scope of this quickstart to demonstrate more advanced features. In particular</p>
<ul>
<li>The Service does not implement the required hooks to support recovery in the presence of failures.</li>
<li>It also does not utilize a transactional back-end resource.</li>
<li>Only one web service participates in the protocol. As WS-BA is a coordination protocol, it is best suited to multi-participant scenarios.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a more complete example, please see the XTS demonstrator application that ships with the Narayana project: <a href="http://narayana.io">http://narayana.io</a>.</p>
<p>It is also assumed tht you have an understanding of WS-BusinessActivity. For more details, read the XTS documentation that ships with the Narayana project: <a href="http://narayana.io/docs/product">http://narayana.io/docs/product</a></p>
<p>The application consists of a single JAX-WS web service that is deployed within a WAR archive. It is tested with a JBoss Arquillian enabled JUnit test.</p>
<p>When running the org.jboss.as.quickstarts.wsba.participantcompletion.simple.ClientTest#testSuccess() method, the following steps occur:</p>
<ol>
<li>A new Business Activity is created by the client.</li>
<li>An operation on a WS-BA enabled Web service is invoked by the client.</li>
<li>The <code>JaxWSHeaderContextProcessor</code> in the WS Client handler chain inserts the BA context into the outgoing SOAP message.</li>
<li>When the service receives the SOAP request, the <code>JaxWSHeaderContextProcessor</code> in its handler chain inspects the BA context and associates the request with this BA.</li>
<li>The Web service operation is invoked.</li>
<li>A participant is enlisted in this BA. This allows the Web Service logic to respond to protocol events, such as compensate and close.</li>
<li>The service invokes the business logic. In this case, a String value is added to the set.</li>
<li>The backend resource is prepared. This ensures that the Backend resource can undo or make permanent the change when told to do so by the coordinator.</li>
<li>Providing the above steps where successful, the service notifies the coordinator that it has completed. The service has now made its changes visible and is not holding any locks. Allowing the service to notify completion is an optimisation that prevents the holding of locks, whilst waiting for other participants to complete. This notification is required as the Service participates in the <code>ParticipantCompletion</code> protocol.</li>
<li>The client can then decide to complete or cancel the BA. If the client decides to complete, all participants will be told to close. If the participant decides to cancel, all participants will be told to compensate.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are additional tests that show:</p>
<ul>
<li>What happens when an application exception is thrown by the service.</li>
<li>How the client can cancel a BA.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a href="#system-requirements" id="system-requirements">System Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The application this project produces is designed to be run on Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.1 or later.</p>
<p>All you need to build this project is Java 8.0 (Java SDK 1.8) or later and Maven 3.3.1 or later. See <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/CONFIGURE_MAVEN_JBOSS_EAP7.md#configure-maven-to-build-and-deploy-the-quickstarts">Configure Maven for JBoss EAP 7.1</a> to make sure you are configured correctly for testing the quickstarts.</p>
<h2><a href="#start-the-server" id="start-the-server">Start the Server</a></h2>
<p>Next you need to start JBoss EAP with the XTS subsystem enabled. This is enabled through the optional server configuration <em>standalone-xts.xml</em>. To do this, run the following commands from the top-level directory of JBoss EAP:</p>
<pre><code>For Linux:     ./bin/standalone.sh --server-config=../../docs/examples/configs/standalone-xts.xml | egrep &quot;started|stdout&quot;
For Windows:   \bin\standalone.bat --server-config=..\..\docs\examples\configs\standalone-xts.xml | egrep &quot;started|stdout&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Note, the pipe to egrep (| egrep &quot;started|stdout&quot;) is useful to just show when the server has started and the output from these tests. For normal operation, this pipe can be removed.</p>
<h2><a href="#run-the-arquillian-tests" id="run-the-arquillian-tests">Run the Arquillian Tests</a></h2>
<p>This quickstart provides Arquillian tests. By default, these tests are configured to be skipped as Arquillian tests require the use of a container.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have started the JBoss EAP server as described above.</li>
<li>Open a command prompt and navigate to the root directory of this quickstart.</li>
<li>Type the following command to run the test goal with the following profile activated:
<pre><code>mvn clean verify -Parq-remote
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should see the following result.</p>
<pre><code>Results :

Tests run: 2, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: You see the following warning when you run the Arquillian tests in remote mode.</em></p>
<pre><code>WARNING: Configuration contain properties not supported by the backing object org.jboss.as.arquillian.container.remote.RemoteContainerConfiguration
Unused property entries: {serverConfig=../../docs/examples/configs/standalone-xts.xml}
Supported property names: [managementAddress, password, managementPort, managementProtocol, username]
</code></pre>
<p><em>This is because, in remote mode, you are responsible for starting the server with the XTS subsystem enabled. When you run the Arquillian tests in managed mode, the container uses the <code>serverConfig</code> property defined in the <code>arquillian.xml</code> file to start the server with the XTS subsystem enabled.</em></p>
<p>You can also let Arquillian manage the JBoss EAP server by using the <code>arq-managed</code> profile. For more information about how to run the Arquillian tests, see <a href="https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-developer-shared-resources/blob/master/guides/RUN_ARQUILLIAN_TESTS.md#run-the-arquillian-tests">Run the Arquillian Tests</a>.</p>
